		<p>This website is the finished product for my CS25320(Programming for the Web) Assignment #1.The assignment brief states to 
		"Create a HTML 5 canvas game that uses persistent storage to hold game parameters and leaderboard scores.". This includes a 
		Help page that provides useful and informative help for setting up the game as well as for playing the game as well as an 
		About page that containes two or three sentences saying what you have done, and that provides full and accurate credit for 
		other peopleâ€™s code, libraries, images sounds and ideas.

		The idea for my game was to design a game that was similar to the ever popular game"Flappy Bird" which is the game I took inspiration from.
		I had found a series of tutorial videos all over Youtube which showed me how to code games that are similar to "Flappy Bird" or even the game itself.
		What I have done for this assignment is take code from multiple different tutorials and combine it to work within my assignment. For the main fundementals 
		of the canvas game, I had replicated the code from <a href ="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SsYZDJdeXk&list=LL&index=3&t=184s">
		KnifeCircus's "The Easiest Flappy Bird Tutorial Ever? - Beginner Javascript Game"</a> Youtube Video. The functions are almost identical however I had added my 
		own comments so that I understand the code as well as renaming the variables in the code to make it easier to understand. I then combine the "canvas.js" code 
		with <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3NVwM9cJpM&list=LL&index=2">Tudor Todorescu's "I've coded flappy bird without canvas, using only HTML , CSS , 
		JavaScript- Complete Tutorial"</a> to make the game aesthethically pleasing and look similar to the ever famous "Flappy Bird" Game through the use of an external 
		CSS stylesheet. I have used photoshopped images from the game that I found via Tudor Todorescu's GitHub. 
		</p>

		As for the controls, my initial idea was going to set an Eventlistener to allow the user to click the space bar to control the bird. However, I wanted to stay true 
		to the original game hence I changed the controls to being a single click to cause the bird to "jump" in the game. The user will need to click within the canvas to 
		control the bird as it goes up and down the canvas.Then I added a gravity function to allow the bird to fall down the canvas.
