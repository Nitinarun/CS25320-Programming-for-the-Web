		<p>The aim of the game is to get through as many of the blocks you can and achieve the highest score possible.</p>
		
		<h3><U>How to play the game :</U></h3>
		<p>To play the game, you will need to click your mouse within the green border window to make the character jump up and down the screen. 
		You will be controlling the Flappy Bird game character on screen and will need to guide it through the Green blocks in the gaps. The Flappy Bird
		has gravity and will fall if you do not time it right as it flies through the obstacles. Get as many blocks within the game to get the highest score possible. 
		If you hit one of the blocks, the game will end and your score will be displayed on-screen.
