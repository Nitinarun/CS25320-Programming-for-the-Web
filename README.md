# CS253250---Programming-for-the-Web

This folder within my Github is a representation of the types of content I have learnt for my CS25320 Programming for the Web module within my second year. The Files on this repository are the practicals that were conducted throughout Semester 1 whereby we had learnt a variety of skills and developed a deeper understanding on the following topics within Web programming :

. Design, construct and deploy server-side web software using a major server-side environment and language.
. Access a database and maintain a session using server side code.
. Understand the concepts involved in server side programming, including security implications.
. Create web content which features animated graphics and interactive elements and data persistence.
. Understand the place of different web technologies, graphics, platforms (e.g. mobile), databases, privacy, data security and search engine visibility for creating interactive web content.
